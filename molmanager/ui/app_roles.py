"""Kernel roles: the slices of the window a collaborator is allowed to need.

``AppKernel`` is the union of every role here, so the window still satisfies all of
them at once. The point of the split is the *annotation*: a collaborator that takes
``ProgressChrome`` cannot quietly start reading the SQLite store, and the roles it
does take show up in its constructor signature instead of being buried in method
bodies.

Attribute names match the historical window ``self`` so mixin bodies can run
against a role without copying ``MolStore`` / table rows. See
``docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`` for how roles relate to the collaborator layer.
