"""Lazy leaf-tool adapters (cluster, dimred, QSAR, MPO, medchem, structure-prep).

Importing this module does not import the tool mixins or their dialogs.
First use of a property loads that mixin and binds it to the kernel.

New tools belong here (or as module functions + ``install_window_forwards``),
not as ``ChemistryWorkspaceWindow`` bases. ``bind_mixin_methods`` on these
hosts is the existing adapter pattern; new methods on a real collaborator
should use ``self._app`` instead.
