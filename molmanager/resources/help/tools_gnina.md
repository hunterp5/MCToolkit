# Gnina

Gnina runs the Gnina docking engine (a Smina/Vina fork with CNN scoring) with a receptor PDB or PDBQT, a ligand file, box center/size, and search settings.

## Goal

Dock prepared ligands into a receptor box and collect poses/scores from MolManager, including CNN pose scores when enabled.

## When to use

Use when PDB/PDBQT receptor prep is done and you want local Gnina runs without leaving the app.

Protein Viewer **Prepare → Fast Prepare…** and **Prepare → Dock File…** fill the receptor PDBQT and numeric search box (crystal-ligand AABB + padding). The docking **Ligand** field is left empty so you can choose compounds to dock. The crystal ligand extracted by those tools is kept for **internal validation** (on by default).

## Inputs / scope

Requires a **Gnina** command, receptor PDB or PDBQT, ligands, and an output path. Ligands come from a **file** or from **selected table rows** plus a **conformations** column. Box defined by center and size, or **Autobox**.

On **Windows**, Gnina is the official Linux binary and runs through **Settings → WSL** (same path as AmberTools). Put `gnina` on the WSL PATH, or enter a Linux path such as `/usr/local/bin/gnina`. You can also copy the binary to `molmanager/resources/bin/linux/gnina`. GPU CNN scoring uses CUDA inside WSL. `nvidia-smi` in WSL only checks the Windows GPU driver; Gnina also needs Linux **user-space** CUDA 12 and cuDNN 9 libraries (`libcudnn.so.9`, `libcudart.so.12`, …). If Gnina exits 127 with “error while loading shared libraries”, install those libs in WSL, for example:

`conda create -n gnina-cuda -c nvidia -c conda-forge libcudnn cuda-cudart libcublas libcufft libcusparse libcusolver`

MolManager prepends matching conda `lib` dirs to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. If `nvidia-smi` fails entirely, MolManager adds `--no_gpu`. macOS has no official Gnina binary.

## Options

- **Gnina** - command or path to the binary (WSL PATH name `gnina` on Windows).
- **Receptor**, **Ligand**, **Output** (+ **Browse...**). Receptor may be **PDB or PDBQT**. If the receptor file still contains a ligand, Gnina docks into an **apo** copy. **Ligand** is **File** (SDF; Browse also lists MOL/MOL2; PDBQT is converted to SDF) or **Selected rows**. Selected rows docks each selected table row once; **Conformations** chooses the packed ensemble column (`confs`, `superpose`, …) or **Structure** for the starting 3D geometry (first packed conformer). Gnina then samples poses itself — the rest of the ensemble is not docked as extra ligands. **Save as SDF** (on by default) sets Gnina `--out` to SDF. Uncheck it only if you need PDBQT poses (that format cannot store double/aromatic bonds). Concatenated Meeko PDBQT is converted to one multi-mol SDF and docked in a **single** Gnina process. If Ligand is empty and **Internal validation** is on with a crystal ligand available, Run redocks the crystal ligand only.
- **Autobox** - Gnina `--autobox_ligand` plus **Padding** (`--autobox_add`, default 4 Å). Optional **Browse…** next to the checkbox sets a reference ligand (**PDB or PDBQT**); empty uses the docking ligand. Disables center/size.
- **Flexible side chains** - **Off** (default, rigid receptor), **Distance from ligand**, or **Named residues**. Backbone stays rigid. Distance mode uses `--flexdist` / `--flexdist_ligand` (default 3.5 Å; empty ligand field uses the Autobox / Prepare crystal ligand, then the docking ligand). **Max** (`--flex_max`) keeps only the closest N residues (0 / all keeps every residue in range). Named residues are `CHAIN:RESNUM` (`A:123,A:145`). Gnina writes moved side chains to `{output stem}_flex.pdb` (`--out_flex`). **Write full receptor** adds `--full_flex_output`. The pose browser still overlays the ligand in the original pocket; open the flex PDB to inspect side chains.
- **Center X/Y/Z** and **Size X/Y/Z** - search box when autobox is off.
- **Exhaustiveness**, **Num modes**, **CPU threads**.
- **CNN** - `rescore` (default), `none` (empirical Vina/Vinardo only), or `refinement` (slower). Optional built-in model (`dense`, `fast`, `crossdock_default2018`) and pose sort (`CNNscore`, `CNNaffinity`, `Energy`).
- **Use GPU** - CUDA when available; uncheck to force `--no_gpu`.
- **Internal validation** - on by default. When a crystal ligand is available (still in the receptor file, or the Dock File / Fast Prepare sidecar), redock it with the same box and search settings. The log and pose-browser title report **crystal RMSD** (Å, heavy atoms, no superposition) of the top-ranked validation pose versus the crystallographic coordinates. Pose-browser rows include **crystalRMSD** and **crystalRef** (the ligand residue or file used as that reference). Uncheck to skip the extra run.
- **Minimize Docked Poses** - after docking, run `gnina --minimize` on all poses in one process. The SDF/PDBQT include both the **placement** pose and the **minimized** pose (`poseStage`).
- **Working dir**, **Extra args**.
- **Run Gnina** / **Stop** / **Close**.

## Workflow

1. On Windows, confirm **Settings → WSL** and that `gnina` works in that distro (`command -v gnina`). On Linux, set the Gnina path if it is not on PATH. Download the prebuilt binary from [github.com/gnina/gnina/releases](https://github.com/gnina/gnina/releases) if it is missing.
2. Choose receptor, ligands (**File** or **Selected rows** + **Conformations**), and output paths.
3. Define the box (center/size, or **Autobox**) and search / CNN parameters.
4. **Run Gnina**, monitor progress, **Stop** if needed. When the run finishes, poses are packed into a **poses** column on the matching table rows (or new rows for file-docked ligands), and they open in the **pose browser**, docked in the Protein Viewer **Manager** when that window is open (full Manager column; **header arrows** switch to the chain list; **Undock** for a floating window). If Protein Viewer is not open, the pose browser floats on its own. If **poses** already exists, a new run writes **poses (1)** (then **poses (2)**, …) so earlier ensembles are kept. The table lists every pose for the current ligand (`CNNscore`, `CNNaffinity`, affinity, RMSD, **crystalRef**, mode, and other Gnina fields when present); click a row to show that pose. **← / →** (or Home / End) switch among docked ligands when more than one structure was docked. The 3D pane shows the **ligand pose only**; if **Protein → Viewer** is open, the same pose is also drawn in that pocket **with the crystal ligand still visible** (docked pose carbons are magenta). **Pose Browser Settings** can **Add pose to Viewer** or **Add all poses to Viewer** so they appear as Manager structures beside the crystal complex. Closing the pose browser removes that overlay. **Pose Browser Settings** (gear) also controls ligand drawing style and **Save poses**. The SDF (or PDBQT) is also written to the output path. **Protein → Dock Ligand → Pose Browser** brings the pane back if you closed it, including after **File → Session → Open Session** (the last run is stored with the packed **poses** column).

## Use cases

- Redock a crystallographic ligand to validate the box (**Internal validation**, on by default when a crystal ligand is present).
- Sample pocket side chains (**Flexible side chains → Distance from ligand** or **Named residues**) when induced fit is expected.
- Dock a small selected series with higher exhaustiveness.
- Compare empirical Vina/Vinardo (`CNN: None`) with default CNN rescoring.

## Tips and limits

Docking quality hinges on box placement and ligand/receptor prep. Prefer an SDF ligand; PDBQT stores AutoDock types, not Kekulé orders. Covalent docking and custom CNN `.pt` models are Extra-args only in this dialog. Flexible side chains are in the **Flexible side chains** section (not Extra). Long CNN refinement jobs occupy the GPU - prefer **Rescore** for screening. Prebuilt Gnina is Linux/WSL; do not expect a native Windows `.exe`.
