## Package layout

`molmanager/` holds no loose modules other than the `app.py` entry point; every module lives in a
subpackage named for its subject. File names describe what the module does, so the flat listing of a
subpackage reads as its table of contents.

| Package | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| `platform_support/` | Process, config, and runtime concerns: `config.py`, `app_logging.py`, `bundled_paths.py`, `wsl_launcher.py`, `qt_webengine_flags.py`, `rdkit_runtime_setup.py`, `memory_guards.py`, `memory_usage.py`, `performance_tracking.py`, `exception_policy.py`, `tool_progress.py` |

| `ionization/` | `unipka_ensembles.py`, `unipka_enumerator.py`, `microstate_cache.py` |

| `docking/` | `gnina_job.py`, `gnina_launch.py`, `pose_file_io.py`, `search_box.py`, `redock_validation.py` |
| `predictions/` | `som_prediction.py`, `permeability_prediction.py`, `biotransformer_metabolites.py`, `biotransformer_install.py` |
| `sources/` | External compound providers: `chembl_random_compounds.py`, `pubchem_names.py`, `surechembl_api.py`, `random_molecule_sources.py` |
| `analysis/` | `mmp_analysis.py` (pair/transform core), `mmp_session.py`, `mmp_table.py`, `mmp_depict.py`, `mmp_neighborhood_analysis.py`, `activity_cliff_analysis.py`, `sali_analysis.py`, `qsar_models.py`, `mpo_scoring.py`, `medchem_space.py`, `dimensionality_reduction.py`, `table_statistics.py` |
| `plotting/` | Chart computation, no Qt widgets: `plot_axes.py`, `plot_series_collect.py`, `plot_marker_color.py`, `plot_heatmap.py`, `plot_labels.py`, `plot_radar.py`, `plot_statistics_fits.py`, `plotly_legend.py` |
| `table/` | Table data operations and documents: `column_*.py`, `calculator_expressions.py`, `filter_compute.py`, `random_number_columns.py`, `text_file_ingest.py`, `table_file_formats.py`, `session_codec.py`, `structure_depiction_layout.py` |
| `storage/` | `MolStore`, `SqliteTableStore`, `extra_pixmap_store.py`, `structure_render_store.py` |
| `services/` | Pure helpers shared by UI and workers (no Qt, no `molmanager.ui` imports) |
| `workflows/` | What the app should do next, decided without the UI (see *Workflow layer*) |
| `workers/` | Background jobs (see *Chemistry workers layout*) |
| `ui/` | Qt widgets, dialogs, and the main window |

Bundled `resources/` are resolved from the package root via
`platform_support.bundled_paths.package_root()`, never from a module's own `__file__`, so modules can
move between subpackages without breaking resource lookup.

## Workflow layer (`molmanager/workflows/`)

Tool flows historically fused two things in one function: deciding whether a tool can run, and
telling the user why not. That made every decision untestable without a `QApplication` and usually a
whole `ChemistryWorkspaceWindow`. `workflows/` holds the decision half.

Three rules define the layer:

1. A workflow takes plain data or a narrow protocol. It never accepts the window or `AppKernel`.
2. A workflow returns a result object. It never raises a dialog, touches a widget, or imports `PyQt5`.
3. The UI adapter reads widgets into arguments, calls the workflow, and renders the result.

`workflows/tool_readiness.py` is the reference implementation. `plan_activity_analysis` decides from
`headers`, `row_count`, and candidate `activity_columns` whether MMP / Activity Cliffs / SALI / Pair
Network can run, returning usable columns or a `ToolBlocker` reason.
`ui/analysis_job_support.ensure_activity_analysis_ready` keeps its old signature and is now only the
`QMessageBox` mapping over that result, so its four call sites are unchanged.
`tests/test_tool_readiness.py` covers the decisions with no `qapp` fixture.

Versus `services/`: a service computes a value from its inputs; a workflow branches on what the app
should do. With no such branch, the code belongs in `services/`.

When adding or changing a tool flow, extract its decision into `workflows/` first, then change it.
Do not build new workflows on top of `AppKernel` — that protocol exposes the whole window
(stores, table model, undo stack, timers) and depending on it reintroduces the coupling this layer
removes.

## Target architecture and the ratchet

The layering above is the intent; `architecture-ratchet.json` is what enforces it. Two thirds of
the package is still Qt code, so decisions that belong in `workflows/` and computations that
belong in `services/` keep landing in dialogs and mixins. The counters below are frozen at the
values measured when the ratchet landed and may only go **down**
(`python scripts/architecture_metrics.py`, `--offenders <metric>` to list the files).

| Counter | Frozen at | What it measures |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| `window_typed_params` | 80 | Parameters annotated `app: AppKernel` / `app: Any` — code taking the whole window |
| `modules_taking_the_window` | 30 | Modules with at least one such parameter |
| `private_cross_module_access` | 91 | `app._x` / `self._app._x` where `_x` is **not** declared in any `ui/` protocol |
| `deferred_intra_package_imports` | 590 | First-party imports nested in function bodies, i.e. import cycles |
| `mixin_modules` | 75 | `*_mixin.py` files |
| `bind_mixin_methods_sites` | 6 | Legacy binds where a collaborator runs mixin bodies with the window as `self` |
| `rdkit_in_ui_modules` | 52 | Qt modules importing RDKit — chemistry living in the UI |
| `app_kernel_members` | 31 | `AppKernel` surface, roles included |

`private_cross_module_access` deliberately ignores members declared in a role or host protocol.
Otherwise converting a mixin body would raise it every time — a hidden `self._x` becomes a visible
`self._app._x` without any new coupling. What it still counts is undeclared reach, currently 91 uses
of 50 distinct names, led by `_table_cell_text`.

Declaring rather than reaching is the sanctioned move, and `protocols_over_member_cap` is what
keeps it from becoming a loophole: no protocol under `ui/` may declare more than 8 members. That
bound is the useful signal when converting a collaborator — if what it needs will not fit, the
responsibility has not been split yet, and declaring 19 window members would only document the
coupling rather than reduce it.

Invariants that must stay 0: `domain_modules_importing_ui` (`molmanager/app.py` is the
composition root and exempt), `qt_in_decision_layers`, `ui_in_decision_layers`,
`protocols_over_member_cap`. The `ui/` share of the package (64.4%) may not drift up by more than
0.5 points.

The target these counters move toward:

1. **Domain** (`chem/`, `protein/`, `analysis/`, …) — pure computation, no Qt, no app state.
2. **Decisions** (`services/` + `workflows/`) — services compute a value, workflows branch on
   what the app should do next.
3. **Orchestration** (`workers/`, plus collaborators once they no longer need the window) —
   owns sequencing and threading, knows nothing about widgets.
4. **`ui/`** — widgets, dialogs, layout, and thin adapters that read widget state into calls on
   rings 2–3 and render the results.

Two rules make that real, and both are what the counters track. **Per-capability protocols
instead of one kernel:** anything accepting all 31 kernel members can reach the whole window, so
collaborators should take the roles in `ui/app_roles.py` instead (see "Kernel roles" below).
**One table-reader interface:** domain code must not loop `app._table_cell_text`, which is what
currently forces row-walking logic to stay in `ui/`.

## Main window (`molmanager/ui/main_window/`)

`ChemistryWorkspaceWindow` is a **QMainWindow facade** over an explicit GUI-thread kernel
(`molmanager/ui/app_kernel.py`: `AppKernel`) and collaborators. Public methods stay on the
window as one-line forwards so dialogs and tests keep calling `app.on_calc_finished`,
`app._begin_tool_progress`, `app._selected_oids_set`, etc. Most `*_mixin.py` files are
**file-splits of one host class**, not reusable mixins; they are **not** all on the window MRO.

| Collaborator | Module | Owns |
|--------------|--------|------|
| `ProgressController` | `ui/progress_controller.py` | Polled tool progress: poll timer, background-job depth, partial-results notice, status text |
| `ToolDialogScope` | `ui/tool_dialog_scope.py` | Modeless tool dialogs, selected-rows-only scope, empty-selection abort |
| `TableWriteService` | `ui/table_write_service.py` | `on_calc_finished`, unique column names, `_ensure_columns` |
| `TableSession` | `ui/table_session.py` | Selection, chemistry-column lookup, sticky visible-row cache |
| `TableBuildPipeline` | `ui/table_build_pipeline.py` | Ingest chunks, SQLite rebuild, Render 2D batch/results (`QObject` child) |
| `SessionController` | `ui/session_controller.py` | `.cms` save/restore, table layout, session plots, legacy CSV |
| `WorkspaceTools` | `ui/workspace_tools.py` | Lazy cluster / dimred / QSAR / MPO / medchem / structure-prep adapters |
| `PlotDockHost` | `ui/plot_dock_host.py` | Dock/undock plot panes |
| `ProcessQueueManager` | `ui/process_queue.py` | Serial heavy tools |
| `BackgroundActivityHub` | `ui/background_activity.py` | Processes dialog |

### Kernel roles (`molmanager/ui/app_roles.py`)

`AppKernel` is not a list of members any more; it is the union of seven role protocols, and it
declares nothing of its own. `tests/test_app_kernel.py` enforces both, so new kernel surface has
to land in a named role and no single role may exceed 8 members.

| Role | Covers |
|------|--------|
| `ProgressChrome` | Status line and queued-tool progress state |
| `TableData` | `mols`, `headers`, and the table/proxy models |
| `TableSelection` | The view plus the selection and visible-row caches |
| `SessionState` | Dirty flag, oid allocation, filter/zoom state |
| `JobScheduler` | Thread pools, process queue, background-activity hub |
| `StoreAccess` | SQLite store, conformer sidecar, undo stack |
| `CoalescedRefresh` | Debounce timers that collapse edit bursts into one recompute |

Annotate a collaborator with the roles it actually reads, not `AppKernel`. When a collaborator
needs window forwards that are not kernel members, declare a host protocol next to it that
extends the relevant role — `ToolScopeHost` in `ui/tool_dialog_scope.py` is the reference. That
keeps the extra coupling visible in one place so it can be removed later.

Because the roles are the declared contract, the facade has to satisfy them for real: a member no
implementation provides is a bug, not a note-to-self. Do not paper over a missing attribute with
`getattr(self, "_thing", default)` — initialize it where the owning collaborator is built.

The main menubar is data in `ui/main_window/menu_spec.py`. `menu_builder.install_menu_specs`
turns that tree into Qt widgets. Add tools to the spec; do not grow `AppMenuMixin.init_menubar`.
`tests/test_menu_spec.py` asserts structure without constructing a window.

## Mixins vs composition

A mixin is shared behavior used by **more than one** class. Almost all MolManager
`*_mixin.py` modules fail that test: they are method bags for a single host
(`ChemistryWorkspaceWindow`, `PlotWidget`, `CompoundTableModel`, `ProteinViewerDialog`,
`Molecule3DViewerWidget`). State is created on the host `__init__`.

**True mixins** (keep): filter-card chrome (`_FilterCardDragMixin`,
`_FilterCardEnableInvertMixin` in `ui/filters/card_chrome.py`) and
`ProteinStructureSourceMixin` (`ui/dialogs/protein_source_picker.py`).

**Do**

- File-split large Qt classes when one file would be unwieldy.
- Extract a collaborator when there is a stable boundary (progress, column writeback, session IO, ingest/render).
- Put new tools on `WorkspaceTools` (lazy) or as module functions plus `install_window_forwards`.
- Write **new** collaborator methods on the collaborator using `self._app` (`AppKernel`). Do not call `bind_mixin_methods` for new code.
- Keep public names on the window so dialogs/tests keep calling `app.on_calc_finished`.

**Do not**

- Add mixin bases to `ChemistryWorkspaceWindow` (`tests/test_app_kernel.py` freezes the MRO).
- Add empty composite mixins (`ChemistryMixin`-style).
- Treat mixin MRO order as architecture. `QMainWindow` precedes remaining mixins, so Qt virtuals such as `closeEvent` must be declared on the shell (delegating into `AppLifecycleMixin`). Mixin implementations that need the C++ base should call `QMainWindow.closeEvent` explicitly rather than `super()`.

`bind_mixin_methods` is a **legacy bridge**: it copies mixin functions onto a collaborator but still invokes them with the window as `self`. Six collaborators still use it; convert bodies to `self._app` when touching that code.

`ToolDialogScope` shows the conversion, and it is four steps: move the mixin bodies onto the
collaborator rewriting window `self` to `self._app`, move mixin-owned state out of the window
`__init__` and into the collaborator, declare a host protocol for what is left, then point
`install_window_forwards` at the collaborator class instead of the deleted mixin. Call sites do not
change, because they go through those forwards.

A mixin may not convert whole. `AppProgressMixin` held two jobs: the polled tool-progress state
machine, and the status-bar chrome the window itself builds (loading overlay, memory label,
status-bar visibility). Only the first fits an 8-member contract — the chrome drives widgets that
do not exist yet when `ProgressController` is constructed — so the state machine moved onto the
collaborator with `ProgressHost`, and the chrome half stays on the mixin and the legacy bridge.
Splitting by what fits the cap is the intended way to make partial progress; forwards let both
halves answer on the window, so callers never see the seam.

New tools go through `ui/analysis_job_support.py` (which uses `tool_dialog_scope`) and kernel
methods — do not add mixin bases to `ChemistryWorkspaceWindow`.

Remaining mixins on the window MRO are UI adapters that still talk to widgets directly
(`AppMenuMixin`, `TableUIMixin` edit/search/filters, MMP/SALI, dock,
predict, `GuiSettingsMixin`). Empty composition roots (`ChemistryMixin`, `SessionMixin`,
`IngestRenderMixin`, `PrepareStructuresMixin`, `ConformersDescriptorsMixin`,
`ToolsSqlPredictMixin`) are optional groupings only; they are **not** bases of
`ChemistryWorkspaceWindow`.

**Processes Cancel:** `BackgroundActivityHub.try_cancel_row` handles `background` jobs via `cancel_background_job()` when a cancel callable was registered with `register_background_job(..., cancel=…)`. Filter apply, substructure filter, dimred, and MedChem Space register cancel callables.

**Progress chrome (UX Phase 1):** Prepare-structure tools, QSAR train/predict, PDBFixer/PDBQT, dimred, and SQL load pages call `_begin_tool_progress` / `report_tool_progress` / `_finish_tool_progress`. Plot rebuilds register a short-lived Processes row (`Updating plot`) and set status to `Plot: collecting…` before series collect. Render 2D and auto-ingest 2D set status before task collection.

**SQL load:** `SqlLoadWorker` fetches rows and runs `MolFromSmiles` off the GUI thread; `ToolsSqlPredictMixin` applies prepared rows in budgeted `append_rows_batch` chunks. Cancellable via Processes (`register_background_job`).

**SQLite mirror rebuild:** GUI only chunk-exports cell text into memory; `SqliteRebuildWorker` streams inserts + oid index off the GUI (`Indexing table…` progress). Sync `_rebuild_sqlite_store_from_model` remains for tiny/test paths.

**Tool writeback:** `on_calc_finished` inserts columns immediately, then for large result sets chunks `apply_columns_values_bulk` / `set_column_text_by_oids` with `Writing results…` status; coloring and bounds run after the last chunk (`on_complete` for Protonate/fragment/SOM follow-ups). Fingerprint similarity uses the same chunked fill for large tables.

Tool mixins that remain on the window (fragments, MMP/SALI, dock, predict) are thin adapters over `analysis_job_support` and the kernel. Structure-prep (protonate, Fast Prepare, disconnect/neutralize/explicit H) lives on `WorkspaceTools.structure_prep`. Ingest/render/sqlite live on `TableBuildPipeline`; column writeback on `TableWriteService`.

**Filter bounds:** bulk load/ingest calls `schedule_calculate_global_bounds()` (debounced); undo calls `calculate_global_bounds()` immediately when filter cards need fresh min/max. Session restore installs saved `global_bounds` when present and otherwise scans immediately.

## Table and visibility

- **Source of truth:** `CompoundTableModel` (`_rows`, OIDs, batched `dataChanged`) in
  `ui/compound_table_model.py` (file-split: structure / bounds / bulk / color modules).
- **View stack:** `ui/compound_table_view.py` (`CompoundTableView`, `StructureDelegate`,
  `CompoundTableHeaderView`); re-exported from `compound_table_model` for stable imports.
- **Helpers:** `services/numeric_bounds.py` (filter slider min/max scans);
  `column_color_compute.py` (gradient / categorical RGB).
- **Filtered view:** `FilterProxyModel` hides rows by OID set (`set_visible_oids`), not per-row `setRowHidden`.
- **Selection:** Qt selection + `_selected_oids_override` for large selections (tools/plots use `_selected_oids_set()`); logic lives in `TableSession` (`TableSelectionMixin` body).
- **SQLite mirror:** `SqliteTableStore` powers text/numeric filter pushdown and column search at 100k+ rows. Rebuilt in chunks on the GUI thread, then `SqliteRebuildWorker` builds the DB file.

## Background work

| Mechanism | Used for |
|-----------|----------|
| `ProcessQueueManager` | Serial heavy tools (descriptors, cluster, export, …) |
| `threadpool` | Substructure filter, dimred, MedChem space, SQLite export chunks |
| `_render_threadpool` | 2D structure rendering |
| `_background_jobs` + `BackgroundActivityHub` | **Processes** dialog rows for non-queue work |

Progress: `WorkerSignals.tool_progress` + `ToolProgressState` polling → bottom `status_label`.

## Plots and table sync

- **Plotter:** `ui/plot.py` (`PlotWidget`)
- **Dock host:** `ui/plot_dock_host.py` (`PlotDockHost`) owns dock/undock, panel width, and pane close; `PlotToolsMixin` delegates the public API
- **PCA / radar / dimred:** `ui/plotly_interactive_view.py`; dimred panel is `ui/dialogs/dimred_panel.py` (`DockableResultPlotPanel`), method dialogs stay in `ui/dialogs/dimensionality_reduction.py`
- **MedChem space:** `ui/dialogs/medchem_space.py` (`MedChemPlotPanel` also subclasses `DockableResultPlotPanel`)
- **Table → DataFrame:** `ui/table_dataframe.py` (Statistics, QSAR, MMP, dimred, and medchem-space)
- **Statistics:** `analysis/table_statistics.py` is Qt-free (outliers, curve fit, hypothesis tests); `ui/dialogs/data_analysis.py` is the shell; tab widgets live in `ui/dialogs/data_analysis_tabs.py`
- **MMP:** `analysis/mmp_analysis.py` is pair/transform core; session ledger payloads live in `mmp_session.py`, table write-back in `mmp_table.py`, pair-atom highlights in `mmp_depict.py`
- **Split / Join columns:** shared delimiter combo + custom field in `ui/dialogs/delimiter_picker.py`
- **Data-menu constructors:** QSAR, MPO Scoring, and the dimred panel `__init__` only orchestrate `_init_*_state` / `_build_*_ui` / `_wire_*_ui` (same pattern as Statistics and Fast Prepare)
- **Shared helpers:** `ui/plot_table_sync.py` (selection mapping, clear override); `ui/plotly_shell.py` + `ui/plotly_shell.html` (interactive Plotly HTML/JS for Plotter + Plotly views)
- **Result maps:** `ui/result_plot_panel.py` (`DockableResultPlotPanel`) is the shared dock chrome for SALI / MMP / cliffs / dimred / MedChem
- **Docked-plot chrome:** `ui/dockable_plot.py` re-exports glyphs, floating titles, footer buttons, and pane embed (`dockable_plot_glyphs.py`, `_title.py`, `_chrome.py`, `_embed.py`)
- **Workspace panes:** `ui/main_window/plot_pane.py` (`PlotPane`); `ui/main_window/workspace_layout.py` (`WorkspaceLayoutManager`)
- **Result browsers:** `ui/browsers/` (SOM, selection, MMP, SALI, metabolites) with shims at `ui/*_browser.py`
- **Filters:** `FilterPanelMixin` is a file-split of the window filter panel (cards/apply/substructure/bounds) under `ui/filters/`. True mixins are card chrome only (`card_chrome.py`); `cards.py` is the barrel.
- **Conformer writeback:** `ui/main_window/conformer_writeback.py` (table append / packed ensemble / superpose mol lookup); `ConformersToolsMixin` stays the UI adapter
- **Table → plot:** debounced `_schedule_sync_active_plots_from_table_selection`
- **Plot → table:** `apply_table_selection_for_source_rows`
- **Filters / edits:** `_schedule_active_plots_replot` after filter apply; `dataChanged` on model for open plots
- **Substructure (large tables):** one or more SMARTS cards run via `SubstructureFilterWorker` off the GUI; sync/chunked apply consume override OID sets
- **UI workflow benchmark:** `scripts/benchmark_ui_workflows.py` times CSV load, `.cms` restore, filters, plot collect/replot, search, export
- **pKa / Uni-pKa benchmark:** `scripts/benchmark_pka.py` splits enumerate vs Uni-pKa MMFF/LMDB vs Uni-Mol infer and compares chunk sizes

## Adding a new Tool

1. Dialog under `molmanager/ui/dialogs/` (use `scope.selection_scope_checked`, `parent_app` on docked panels).
   Protein Prepare, Gnina dock, and Data Analysis live there; shims remain at the old `ui/`
   paths. Package `__init__` loads exports lazily so submodule imports do not pull Qt WebEngine.
2. Worker under `molmanager/workers/` if work is heavy.
3. Wire the menu action on `ChemistryWorkspaceWindow` as a **thin forward** to `WorkspaceTools` or an existing collaborator (`install_window_forwards`). Do **not** add a new mixin base to the window class. New collaborator methods use `self._app`, not `bind_mixin_methods`.
4. Long jobs: `process_queue.enqueue` + `_begin_tool_progress` / `report_tool_progress`.
5. Short threadpool jobs: `register_background_job` / `unregister_background_job`.
6. Tests under `tests/` (unit tests avoid full GUI where possible).

## Chemistry workers layout

Heavy chemistry jobs are split by concern (compat re-exports remain in `workers/chemistry_tools.py` and `workers/chemistry_conformers.py`):

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| `workers/chemistry_descriptors.py` | Descriptor `CalcWorker` |
| `workers/conformer_generation.py` | Stochastic ETKDG conformer generation |
| `workers/superpose.py` | QRunnable adapters; re-exports geom/conformers/structures/RMSD |
| `workers/superpose_geom.py` | Ring maps, 2D depiction match, atom maps |
| `workers/superpose_conformers.py` | Align conformers of one molecule |
| `workers/superpose_structures.py` | Align distinct molecules onto a reference |
| `workers/superpose_rmsd.py` | Per-conformer RMSD |
| `workers/strain_energy.py` | Strain energy + overlay helpers |
| `workers/chemistry_calc.py` | Custom calculator (AST `calculator_expressions`) |
| `workers/chemistry_worker_common.py` | Shared progress throttling and force-field names |

Pure helpers live under `molmanager/services/` (e.g. `chemistry_columns.py`, `sql_load_policy.py`,
`table_scope.py`, `activity_records.py`, `table_selection.py`, `sqlite_text_match.py`,
`filter_config.py`, `column_labels.py`, `structure_grouping.py`). Domain modules must not import
`molmanager.ui`; Plotly legend cleanup lives in `molmanager/plotting/plotly_legend.py` (re-exported from
`ui/plotly_html.py`). Shared lineage header is `COLUMN_PARENT_OID` (`"Parent OID"`).
MMP / Activity Cliff / Pair Network / SALI share `ui/analysis_job_support.py` for scoped
activity-record prep, process-queue enqueue (`start_scoped_activity_job`), dialog open/finish
helpers (`ensure_activity_analysis_ready`, `finish_analysis_pairs`, `report_analysis_failure`).
Cluster / pKa / SOM / protomer / permeability reuse the same module for table readiness
(`ensure_table_ready_for_tool`), structure-scoped mol collect (`prepare_scoped_structure_mols`),
enqueue (`enqueue_process_queue_job` / `start_scoped_structure_job`), and cancellable failure
reporting (`report_cancellable_job_failure`). Tool adapters and dialogs stay thin over those helpers.

Filter visibility changes invalidate a sticky `_visible_source_rows_cache` used by
plot replot (so debounced Plotter rebuilds do not rematerialize proxy maps per host).
`FilterProxyModel` is an explicit OID→row map (`QAbstractProxyModel`): `set_visible_oids`
rebuilds the accepted source-row list once instead of
`QSortFilterProxyModel.invalidateFilter` walking every row. `visible_source_rows()` seeds
the sticky cache without a `mapToSource` loop. Column insert/remove is forwarded 1:1
(`beginInsertColumns` / `beginRemoveColumns`) so the table view updates section count;
without that, deletes leave blank columns and new descriptor columns never appear.
When visibility does not change, finalize skips reset/replot.

Plotter axis/mode/histogram helpers live in `molmanager/plotting/plot_axes.py` (re-exported from
`ui/plot.py`). Series collection for scatter/histogram lives in `molmanager/plotting/plot_series_collect.py`.
Floating plot chrome is split into `ui/plot_bridge.py`, `ui/plot_statistics_panel.py`, and
`ui/plot_dialog.py`. Figure / shell / style / axis / radar / collect / session modules under
`ui/plot_*_mixin.py` are a **file-split of `PlotWidget`** (`ui/plot.py` owns UI construction).
Fingerprint session cache is an LRU capped by `fingerprint_cache_max_entries`
(`MOLMANAGER_FINGERPRINT_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES`).

Ligand 3D viewer: `ui/mol_viewer_3d.py` re-exports. HTML/JS assembly is
`ui/mol_3d_html.py` (shared `assemble_3dmol_shell_page`), RDKit 2D/3D prep is
`ui/mol_3d_prepare.py`, Qt widgets are `ui/mol_3d_widget.py` (conformer nav + dock chrome mixins), and the floating
dialog/openers are `ui/mol_3d_dialog.py`. The sketcher embed is `ui/mol_3d_embed.py`;
strain-energy table fill is `ui/mol_3d_strain.py`. Protein viewer: `ui/protein_viewer.py`
re-exports; HTML is `ui/protein_viewer_html.py` (init script: `ui/protein_viewer.js`), canvas is `ui/protein_embed.py`,
chain list is `ui/protein_chain_manager.py`. The window (`ui/protein_viewer_dialog.py`) is a file-split (IO/session, render-style/H-bond, sequence).
Crystallographic inventory: `structure_components.py` re-exports types, CIF IO,
chain inventory, and atoms/pocket helpers.
`TableWriteService` owns descriptor/tool column writeback and unique header naming.
Structure-prep tools (protonate, Fast Prepare, disconnect/neutralize/explicit H) live on
`WorkspaceTools.structure_prep`; Render 2D start/flush lives on `TableBuildPipeline` with ingest and SQLite rebuild.
Protein Prepare runtime: `workers/protein_prepare_runtime.py` orchestrates;
IO/residue maps are `protein_prepare_io.py`, pdb2pqr is `protein_prepare_pdb2pqr.py`,
AmberTools GAFF/GAFF2 (WSL on Windows) is `protein_prepare_amber.py`,
OpenMM min is `protein_prepare_minimize.py`. Complex-only Minimize (viewer **Minimize…**) is `protein_complex_minimize.py` with dialog `ui/dialogs/protein_minimize.py`. Tests patch names on the runtime module.

Gnina dock: `ui/dialogs/gnina_dock.py` is the widget. Argv, ligand files, and pose
I/O live in `gnina_job.py` (no Qt). `workers/gnina_dock_worker.py` owns the
`QProcess` and dock → optional crystal validation → optional minimize sequencing.
Launch/WSL/GPU probing stays in `gnina_launch.py`. Compat shims remain at
`ui/gnina_dock.py` / `ui/smina_dock.py`.

Auto Render 2D after ingest/session: the loading overlay stays until filter bounds
are ready and restored plot views have settled. Auto Structure renders start in the
background and do not block the workspace. Above `auto_render_2d_max_rows` auto 2D
is skipped. Lazy PNG store thresholds (`structure_render_lazy_*`) still control how
images are stored, not when the workspace appears. Session files store 2D mol
binaries and numeric filter bounds so Open can skip SMILES re-parse and a full
bounds scan.
