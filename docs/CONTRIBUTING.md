# Contributing to mctoolkit

This document is the versioned source of project coding standards for humans and CI.
Cursor-specific copies live under [`.cursor/rules/`](../.cursor/rules/) (tracked in git).

## Coding standards

### Copyright headers

- Every **new** first-party source file must include the standard GPL copyright header (see `.cursor/rules/copyright-headers.mdc`).
- Keep a shebang as line 1 when present; put the header immediately below it.
- Do **not** add the header to vendored/third-party assets (e.g. `mctoolkit/ui/static/`).
- Full header text: [`.cursor/rules/copyright-headers.mdc`](../.cursor/rules/copyright-headers.mdc).
- Check: `python scripts/check_gpl_headers.py`
- Bulk insert: `python scripts/add_gpl_headers.py`

### Python style and formatting

- Follow **PEP 8** and keep code clean and maintainable.
- Format and lint Python with **Ruff** (`pyproject.toml` `[tool.ruff]`).
- Prefer **type hints** for public functions and non-trivial internal helpers.
- Avoid redundant comments; only comment on non-obvious intent or trade-offs.

```bash
python -m ruff check mctoolkit tests scripts
python -m ruff format mctoolkit tests scripts
```

CI gates on `ruff check` (correctness / undefined-name rules plus unused imports and locals:
`E9`, `F63`, `F7`, `F82`, `F401`, `F841`, plus the silent-exception ratchet `BLE001`, `S110`,
`SIM105`) and `ruff format --check`.

### Naming conventions

- **snake_case** for variables and functions.
- **PascalCase** for classes.
- Descriptive names; avoid single-letter names except conventional loop indices.

### Quality and correctness

- Fix problems at the **cause**, not the symptom.
- Keep the UI responsive by offloading heavy work off the GUI thread (`ProcessQueueManager`, `QThreadPool`, workers).
- Keep changes cohesive; avoid drive-by refactors unless required.
- New tools: dialog → worker (if heavy) → `WorkspaceTools` or collaborator + window forward → tests. Do **not** add mixin bases to `ChemistryWorkspaceWindow`. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) (Mixins vs composition).
- New menubar items go in `mctoolkit/ui/main_window/menu_spec.py` (plain data). `init_menubar` only installs that tree. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) (Main window).
- Put "can this run / what should happen next" decisions in `mctoolkit/workflows/`: plain-data arguments in, result object out, no Qt. The UI adapter renders the result. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) (Workflow layer).
- Most `*_mixin.py` files are file-splits of one host class. True mixins (shared by multiple classes) are filter-card chrome and `ProteinStructureSourceMixin` only.
- New collaborator methods use `self._app`. `bind_mixin_methods` is a legacy bridge.

### Exception handling

- Prefer narrow `except` clauses and re-raise unexpected failures.
- Do not use `except Exception: pass`. For a specific, expected failure use
  `contextlib.suppress(SomeError)` or handle the error. For a non-fatal path that must catch
  `Exception`, call `mctoolkit.platform_support.exception_policy.log_swallowed_exception` and add
  `# noqa: BLE001` with a short reason (worker/process boundary, Qt object already deleted, and
  similar).
- New `except Exception` / `try-except-pass` in files that are not on the allowlist fail CI
  (`BLE001`, `S110`, `SIM105`). Existing sites are listed in [`ruff.exception-ratchet.toml`](../ruff.exception-ratchet.toml).
  When you clean a file, delete its line there, decrement `ratchet-max-files`, and lower
  `EXCEPTION_RATCHET_MAX_FILES` in `tests/test_exception_ratchet.py`. Never add files.
- File logging is on by default (`mctoolkit/platform_support/app_logging.py`); override with `MCTOOLKIT_LOG_DIR`,
  disable with `MCTOOLKIT_LOG_TO_FILE=0`. Uncaught exceptions show a crash dialog with the log path.

### Architecture ratchet

- Coupling counters are frozen in [`architecture-ratchet.json`](../architecture-ratchet.json) and gated by
  `tests/test_architecture_ratchet.py` plus CI. They may only go **down**.
- Report: `python scripts/architecture_metrics.py`. Blame a metric:
  `python scripts/architecture_metrics.py --offenders rdkit_in_ui_modules`.
- After a cleanup lands, re-freeze: `python scripts/architecture_metrics.py --write-baseline`.
- If a counter grows, the fix is to put the decision in `mctoolkit/workflows/` or the
  computation in `mctoolkit/services/` rather than the Qt layer. See
  [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#target-architecture-and-the-ratchet).
- Reaching into window state (`self._app._x`) counts against `private_cross_module_access` unless
  `_x` is declared in a role in [`mctoolkit/ui/app_roles.py`](../mctoolkit/ui/app_roles.py) or in
  a host protocol beside the collaborator. Declare what a collaborator needs instead of taking the
  whole window — but no protocol may declare more than 8 members
  (`protocols_over_member_cap` must stay 0), so a contract that will not fit means the
  responsibility still needs splitting.

### Git commits

- Prefer concise commit messages focused on **why**.
- **Never** add `Co-authored-by: Cursor`, `cursoragent@cursor.com`, or similar agent attribution to commits or PRs.

## Sketcher / chemistry docs

Before changing structure drawing or stereo behavior, read:

- [IUPAC_DRAWING.md](IUPAC_DRAWING.md) and [`.cursor/rules/iupac-drawing-sketcher.mdc`](../.cursor/rules/iupac-drawing-sketcher.mdc)
- [STEREO_AND_ISOMERISM.md](STEREO_AND_ISOMERISM.md)
- [VALENCE_BONDS_AND_AROMATICITY.md](VALENCE_BONDS_AND_AROMATICITY.md)

## Tests and CI

```bash
# with venv active
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen   # Windows: $env:QT_QPA_PLATFORM="offscreen"
python -m pytest tests/ -v
python scripts/check_gpl_headers.py
python -m ruff check mctoolkit tests scripts
python -m ruff format --check mctoolkit tests scripts
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on **Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows**: lint/header checks, pytest, Linux perf gate, and a dependency audit that **fails on CRITICAL/HIGH/malware** findings (see [dependency-audit-exceptions.md](dependency-audit-exceptions.md)).

### Qt WebEngine is disabled under `offscreen`

Chromium needs a real windowing surface. Constructing a `QWebEngineView` or a
`QWebEnginePage` under `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` **aborts the process** instead of raising,
so every lazy WebEngine bootstrap checks
`platform_support.qt_webengine_flags.webengine_views_supported()` first and takes its no-web
fallback.

Consequences when writing tests:

- Under the default headless run, 3D/protein/dock viewers build **without** a web view. Tests
  must assert against the fallback (e.g. `_standalone_web is None`), not the web path.
- Do not "fix" a viewer test by pre-importing `QtWebEngineWidgets`. Before this guard, whether
  a view was built depended on whether some earlier module imported WebEngine before
  `QApplication` existed, which made crashes appear in unrelated later tests.
- Real coverage of the web paths needs a display: run locally without `QT_QPA_PLATFORM`, or on
  Linux under `xvfb-run`.

### Known flake: intermittent native abort on full Windows runs

A full Windows run aborts (`0xC0000005`, sometimes `0xC0000409`) in roughly half of runs. The same
commit and command pass on one run and abort on the next, so **an abort is not evidence that your
change broke something** — reproduce it before you bisect.

What is known, measured on one unchanged tree over eight runs:

- Aborts cluster in `tests/test_protein_viewer.py` (three of six), but one landed in
  `tests/test_fast_prepare_pipeline.py`, so the victim test is not the cause.
- There is no Python traceback, and the faulthandler dump holds no mctoolkit frames. This is
  native state, not an error in the test that happened to be running.
- Capture mode is not a reliable workaround. Three `--capture=sys` runs passed and a fourth
  aborted; `--capture=sys` is still the configured default because an fd-captured abort throws the
  native diagnostics away, while `--capture=sys` lets them reach the terminal.
- **Splitting the run into two processes passed both**, which is the practical workaround:

```bash
python -m pytest -q --ignore=tests/test_protein_viewer.py
python -m pytest -q tests/test_protein_viewer.py
```

Every viewer module also passes on its own. The fix is real process isolation for the
WebEngine-touching modules; until then, use the split above to get a trustworthy green.
